# FirstWebApp
My first attempt at a web app that uses conv. neural net

In this project I developed a convolutional neural network from scratch using Python. The idea of this neural network is to read in an image of a face and determine if the user would find the individual as trustworthy or not. The choice to use a convolutional neural network came about as a result of this brand of neural network's ability to identify edges in passed in photos which is ideal for a situation where we are training with images of people. The inspiration came from the idea that explaining what an individual finds as trustworthy or not trustworthy is a very unexplainable, in a similar way that it is very difficult to explain to someone what the color red looks like. Thus I used this neural network to give some concrete explanation of what an individual might deem as trustowrthy so we can get a deeper look into the perspective of others. After creating this neural network with a success of 73% I connected it to a Flask front end that used SQLAlchemy as a database and hosted on the free web hosting server PythonAnywhere. I think the primary challenge I encountered was in optimizing the convolutional neural network because it would take way too much time to run through the algorithm which made the website even timeout in certain cases. Thank you to the Chicago Face Database for providing a database of over 600 images of individuals to train with.
